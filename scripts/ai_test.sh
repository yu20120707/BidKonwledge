Placeholder: replace scripts/ai_test.sh with this project's real test commands.

Guidance:
- Run unit tests first, then integration or system tests as appropriate.
- Keep failure output visible.
- Do not delete failing tests to make the run pass.
- If tests cannot run, document the reason in the task artifacts.
- Do not install dependencies here.
- Do not modify business source code here.

Example shape only, not a default:
  python -m pytest backend/tests
